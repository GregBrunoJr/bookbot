# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This is a simple program that reads the contents of a text file and provides the number of words in the file
as well as a count of each alpha character.

Usage: `python3 main.py <path_to_book>`


Here is an example of the output when providing a text file:
```
============ BOOKBOT ============
Analyzing book found at books/frankenstein.txt
----------- Word Count ----------
There are 428090 words in books/frankenstein.txt

Please note that commits are made directly to main as the purpose of this project is to tinker with Python
to get more experience with the language.
