# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

This is a simple program that reads the contents of a text file and provides the number of words in the file
as well as a count of each alpha character.

Please note that commits are made directly to main as the purpose of this project is to tinker with Python
to get more experience with the language.
